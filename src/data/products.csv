The SUR-FIT Natura® Flange System signals a secure, accurate closure with a series of audible “clicks”. A simple snap-off, snap on design allows users to change the pouch quickly to match activities without removing the skin barrier from the skin. Durahesive® skin barriers are designed for people whose stoma output is mostly liquid. Unlike other skin barriers that can break down around liquid output, Durahesive® skin barriers swell up to protect the stoma. This special effect, called turtlenecking, helps create a more secure seal without harming the skin. Durahesive® skin barriers are also easy to fit, apply, and remove. They will adhere securely to the skin while showering, bathing, and swimming.	413162	Skin Barrier, Cut-to-Fit, Flexible, Tape Collar, White, 2 1/4" Flange, 5" x 5", 10/bx (Continental US Only)	v15374.jpg	https://secure.ndc-inc.com/AIMImage/iv15374.jpg	CVT 413162	bx	68.2000	5		Stock Item	4	Extended Care/Home Health	44	Incontinence 	483	Ostomy	N	N

Mild chromic sutures are specially treated for ophthalmic and cuticular applications. The manufacture of catgut raw material, consisting of long ribbons of highly selected serosal tissue, ensures: Purity of collagen for optimal tensile strength and in-vivo performance; Uniform treatment with a buffered chromium salt solution, resulting in a chromic strand with a more predictable strength and uniform in-vivo absorption; Surface smoothness to facilitate knot run-down and knot strength, due to electronic polishing of each strand. CHROMIC GUT sutures are indicated for use in general soft tissue approximation and/or ligation, including use in ophthalmic surgery, but not in cardiovascular or neurological surgery.

Flexible polyurethane material, thermosensitive catheter material provides optimal stiffness during insertion and softens up to 50% post-insertion for vessel conformity and patient comfort. Radiopaque polyurethane allows for quick and easy visualization during diagnostic imaging. Third infusion lumen provides a third, independent, 19G infusion lumen that can be treated as a dedicated line for blood access and fluid or medication delivery. Laser-cut side slot Improves catheter flow rates and reduces the likelihood for positional occlusion and clot formation by minimizing debris attachment. Soft, atraumatic green tip reduces the likelihood of vessel trauma during insertion.	8888345611HP	High Pressure Triple Lumen Acute Dialysis Catheter Kit, 16cm, Curved Extensions, 12 FR, 5 kit/ctn (Continental US Only)			MAL 8888345611HP	ctn	603.2100	0		14-21 Days	8	IV Products	76	IV Catheters	575	Specialty Catheters	N	N

The outside film acts as a bacterial barrier, and the silver inhibits microbial growth in the dressing, which helps to prevent colonization. Silver is added to the dressing to prevent bacterial growth within the dressing. This product contains 79 ppm of elemental silver bound within the wound dressing. Dressings provide physical separation between the wound and external environments to assist in preventing bacterial contamination of the wound. Soft, breathable outside film provides moisture vapor transmission from the foam layer for exudates management. Absorbent and conformable pad. Low-allergy gelatin-free adhesive. Wound contact layer is laminated PE net, preventing sticking to wounds. Individually packed in peel pouch and ETO sterilized.

This special effect, called turtlenecking, helps create a more secure seal without harming the skin. ConvaTec Moldable Technology™ skin barriers provided a personalized, custom fit around the stoma to help protect the peristomal skin. They require no cutting or guess work making them very easy to use. Available in flat and convex skin barrier. Convex is good for people with a retracted or flush stoma.	413423	Skin Barrier, Stomahesive, with Mold-to-Fit Opening and Acrylic Tape Collar, White, 2 1/4" Flange, 1 1/4" - 1 3/4" Stoma Opening, 10/bx (Continental US Only)			CVT 413423	bx	40.4600	2		14-21 Days	4	Extended Care/Home Health	44	Incontinence 	483	Ostomy	N	N

They are packaged in a solution of 89% isopropanol, 10% water and 1% triethanolmaine. Chromic gut is treated with chromic salt solution. Mild chromic sutures are specially treated for ophthalmic and cuticular applications. The manufacture of catgut raw material, consisting of long ribbons of highly selected serosal tissue, ensures: Purity of collagen for optimal tensile strength and in-vivo performance; Uniform treatment with a buffered chromium salt solution, resulting in a chromic strand with a more predictable strength and uniform in-vivo absorption; Surface smoothness to facilitate knot run-down and knot strength, due to electronic polishing of each strand. CHROMIC GUT sutures are indicated for use in general soft tissue approximation and/or ligation, including use in ophthalmic surgery, but not in cardiovascular or neurological surgery.

This protein is derived from the domesticated silkworm species Bombyx mori of the family bombycidae. The silk fibers are treated to remove the naturally-occurring sericin gum, bleached and braided to produce SOFSILK™ surgical silk sutures. The braided sutures are available coated uniformly with silicone or wax to reduce capillarity and to increase surface lubricity to enhance handling characteristics, ease of passage through tissue and knot run-down properties. The manufacturing process, from braiding to coating, gives the suture superior softness and compliance for maximum surgical hand. The proprietary coating process provides smooth flow through tissue while maintaining optimal knot security. SOFSILK™ sutures are indicated for use in general soft tissue approximation and/or ligation, including use in cardiovascular, ophthalmic and neurological surgery.

AIM	10239997	89	10000446	Medtronic/Minimally Invasive Therapies Group	10020331	MEDTRONIC SOFSILK™ SILK SUTURES	SOFSILK™ silk sutures are nonabsorbable, sterile, non-mutagenic surgical sutures composed of natural proteinaceous silk fibers called fibroin. This protein is derived from the domesticated silkworm species Bombyx mori of the family bombycidae. The silk fibers are treated to remove the naturally-occurring sericin gum, bleached and braided to produce SOFSILK™ surgical silk sutures. The braided sutures are available coated uniformly with silicone or wax to reduce capillarity and to increase surface lubricity to enhance handling characteristics, ease of passage through tissue and knot run-down properties. The manufacturing process, from braiding to coating, gives the suture superior softness and compliance for maximum surgical hand. The proprietary coating process provides smooth flow through tissue while maintaining optimal knot security. SOFSILK™ sutures are indicated for use in general soft tissue approximation and/or ligation, including use in cardiovascular, ophthalmic and neurological surgery.

The system consists of the SCD EXPRESS™ controller, non-disposable tubing and single patient use leg garments. The compression sleeve contains three bladders to deliver circumferential, sequential and gradient compression to ensure clearance of the deep veins without the risk of distal blood trapping. The sleeve is anatomically designed with adjustable sleeve closure offering a customized fit for each patient. The SCD EXPRESS™ Compression System offers a clinician the option of two different prophylactic methods with one controller; leg compression and foot compression. This new system provides a number of unique features that improve prophylaxis for every patient. The SCD EXPRESS™ Compression System allows one or two limb operation giving the end user more flexibility for prophylaxis options. The battery operation makes the device transportable for uninterrupted protection throughout a patient's stay in the hospital. The more active or ambulating patients can continue the protection without being tethered to a wall outlet.	9995	Compression System Tubing Set, Compatible Extension (1 pr), 1pr/bx, 10bx/cs (Continental US Only)			KEN 9995	cs	121.6600	0		14-21 Days	12	Orthopedic & Physical Therapy	115	Soft Goods	742	Compression	N	N

It is prepared from fibers of high molecular weight, long-chain, linear polyesters having recurrent aromatic rings as an integral component. It's uniformly coated with polybutilate or poly. The highly adherent coating is a relatively nonreactive nonabsorbable compound which acts as a lubricant to mechanically improve the physical properties of the uncoated suture by improving handling qualities as contrasted to the braided, uncoated fiber. They are braided for optimal handling properties, and for good visibility in the surgical field and are died green.

These filters combine fast flow rates with high loading capacity and the retention of very fine particles, extending into the sub-micron range. Can be used at temperatures up to 500°C and are ideal for use in applications involving air filtration and for gravimetric analysis of volatile materials where ignition is involved. They have a fine capillary structure and can absorb significantly larger quantities of water than an equivalent cellulose filter, making  them suitable for sport tests and liquid scintillation counting methods. Can also be made completely transparent for subsequent microscopic examination.	1827-125	Filter Circles, 125mm Dia, Binder Free Grade 934-AH, 100/pk	v20663.jpg	https://secure.ndc-inc.com/AIMImage/iv20663.jpg	GBS 1827-125	pk	147.7300	15		Stock Item	9	Lab Equipment & Accessories	1059	Filter Papers & Membranes	1030	Glass Microfiber Filters	N	N

They are packaged in a solution of 89% isopropanol, 10% water and 1% triethanolmaine. Chromic gut is treated with chromic salt solution. Mild chromic sutures are specially treated for ophthalmic and cuticular applications. The manufacture of catgut raw material, consisting of long ribbons of highly selected serosal tissue, ensures: Purity of collagen for optimal tensile strength and in-vivo performance; Uniform treatment with a buffered chromium salt solution, resulting in a chromic strand with a more predictable strength and uniform in-vivo absorption; Surface smoothness to facilitate knot run-down and knot strength, due to electronic polishing of each strand. CHROMIC GUT sutures are indicated for use in general soft tissue approximation and/or ligation, including use in ophthalmic surgery, but not in cardiovascular or neurological surgery.

The system consists of the SCD EXPRESS™ controller, non-disposable tubing and single patient use leg garments. The compression sleeve contains three bladders to deliver circumferential, sequential and gradient compression to ensure clearance of the deep veins without the risk of distal blood trapping. The sleeve is anatomically designed with adjustable sleeve closure offering a customized fit for each patient. The SCD EXPRESS™ Compression System offers a clinician the option of two different prophylactic methods with one controller; leg compression and foot compression. This new system provides a number of unique features that improve prophylaxis for every patient. The SCD EXPRESS™ Compression System allows one or two limb operation giving the end user more flexibility for prophylaxis options. The battery operation makes the device transportable for uninterrupted protection throughout a patient's stay in the hospital. The more active or ambulating patients can continue the protection without being tethered to a wall outlet.	93120-SP	Domestic Power Cord, 13 ft, 16 AWG, 1/cs (Continental US Only)			CHC 93120-SP	cs	26.9300	0		Stock Item	12	Orthopedic & Physical Therapy	115	Soft Goods	742	Compression	N	N

AIM	10241302	530	10000685	Cytiva	10028324	CYTIVA GLASS MICROFIBER FILTER PAPERS	Whatman offers two types of glass microfiber filters manufactured from 100% borosilicate glass: binder free that is chemically inert and with binder. These filters combine fast flow rates with high loading capacity and the retention of very fine particles, extending into the sub-micron range. Can be used at temperatures up to 500°C and are ideal for use in applications involving air filtration and for gravimetric analysis of volatile materials where ignition is involved. They have a fine capillary structure and can absorb significantly larger quantities of water than an equivalent cellulose filter, making  them suitable for sport tests and liquid scintillation counting methods. Can also be made completely transparent for subsequent microscopic examination.	1822-6580	Filter Circles, 25mm Dia, Binder Free Grade GF/C, 400/pk	v20804.jpg	https://secure.ndc-inc.com/AIMImage/iv20804.jpg	GBS 1822-6580	pk	224.2200	0		14-21 Days	9	Lab Equipment & Accessories	1059	Filter Papers & Membranes	1030	Glass Microfiber Filters	N	N

These filters combine fast flow rates with high loading capacity and the retention of very fine particles, extending into the sub-micron range. Can be used at temperatures up to 500°C and are ideal for use in applications involving air filtration and for gravimetric analysis of volatile materials where ignition is involved. They have a fine capillary structure and can absorb significantly larger quantities of water than an equivalent cellulose filter, making  them suitable for sport tests and liquid scintillation counting methods. Can also be made completely transparent for subsequent microscopic examination.	1823-257	Filter Circles, 257mm Dia, Binder Free Grade GF/D, 25/pk	v20673.jpg	https://secure.ndc-inc.com/AIMImage/iv20673.jpg	GBS 1823-257	pk	128.6100	0		14-21 Days	9	Lab Equipment & Accessories	1059	Filter Papers & Membranes	1030	Glass Microfiber Filters	N	N

They are easy for clinicians to apply and to remove, with minimal trauma to the patient and to the wound bed. It is the thickest foam dressing, absorbing the most wound fluid. It is non-adhesive, so needs a secondary dressing or tape to hold it in place. This is the only foam in our line that does not have an outer film layer and is ideal for use under compression.

The sleeve is anatomically designed with adjustable sleeve closure offering a customized fit for each patient. The SCD EXPRESS™ Compression System offers a clinician the option of two different prophylactic methods with one controller; leg compression and foot compression. This new system provides a number of unique features that improve prophylaxis for every patient. The SCD EXPRESS™ Compression System allows one or two limb operation giving the end user more flexibility for prophylaxis options. The battery operation makes the device transportable for uninterrupted protection throughout a patient's stay in the hospital.

AIM	10239951	89	10000446	Medtronic/Minimally Invasive Therapies Group	10020331	MEDTRONIC SOFSILK™ SILK SUTURES	SOFSILK™ silk sutures are nonabsorbable, sterile, non-mutagenic surgical sutures composed of natural proteinaceous silk fibers called fibroin. This protein is derived from the domesticated silkworm species Bombyx mori of the family bombycidae. The silk fibers are treated to remove the naturally-occurring sericin gum, bleached and braided to produce SOFSILK™ surgical silk sutures. The braided sutures are available coated uniformly with silicone or wax to reduce capillarity and to increase surface lubricity to enhance handling characteristics, ease of passage through tissue and knot run-down properties. The manufacturing process, from braiding to coating, gives the suture superior softness and compliance for maximum surgical hand. The proprietary coating process provides smooth flow through tissue while maintaining optimal knot security. SOFSILK™ sutures are indicated for use in general soft tissue approximation and/or ligation, including use in cardiovascular, ophthalmic and neurological surgery.

These filters combine fast flow rates with high loading capacity and the retention of very fine particles, extending into the sub-micron range. Can be used at temperatures up to 500°C and are ideal for use in applications involving air filtration and for gravimetric analysis of volatile materials where ignition is involved. They have a fine capillary structure and can absorb significantly larger quantities of water than an equivalent cellulose filter, making  them suitable for sport tests and liquid scintillation counting methods. Can also be made completely transparent for subsequent microscopic examination.	1841-090	Filter Circles, 90mm Dia, Binder Free Multigrade GMF 150, Pore Size 1µm, 20/pk	v20782.jpg	https://secure.ndc-inc.com/AIMImage/iv20782.jpg	GBS 1841-090	pk	60.2200	0		14-21 Days	9	Lab Equipment & Accessories	1059	Filter Papers & Membranes	1030	Glass Microfiber Filters	N	N

They are packaged in a solution of 89% isopropanol, 10% water and 1% triethanolmaine. Chromic gut is treated with chromic salt solution. Mild chromic sutures are specially treated for ophthalmic and cuticular applications. The manufacture of catgut raw material, consisting of long ribbons of highly selected serosal tissue, ensures: Purity of collagen for optimal tensile strength and in-vivo performance; Uniform treatment with a buffered chromium salt solution, resulting in a chromic strand with a more predictable strength and uniform in-vivo absorption; Surface smoothness to facilitate knot run-down and knot strength, due to electronic polishing of each strand. CHROMIC GUT sutures are indicated for use in general soft tissue approximation and/or ligation, including use in ophthalmic surgery, but not in cardiovascular or neurological surgery.

AIM	10345943	530	10000685	Cytiva	10028324	CYTIVA GLASS MICROFIBER FILTER PAPERS	Whatman offers two types of glass microfiber filters manufactured from 100% borosilicate glass: binder free that is chemically inert and with binder. These filters combine fast flow rates with high loading capacity and the retention of very fine particles, extending into the sub-micron range. Can be used at temperatures up to 500°C and are ideal for use in applications involving air filtration and for gravimetric analysis of volatile materials where ignition is involved. They have a fine capillary structure and can absorb significantly larger quantities of water than an equivalent cellulose filter, making  them suitable for sport tests and liquid scintillation counting methods.

AIM	10240105	89	10000446	Medtronic/Minimally Invasive Therapies Group	10020331	MEDTRONIC SOFSILK™ SILK SUTURES	SOFSILK™ silk sutures are nonabsorbable, sterile, non-mutagenic surgical sutures composed of natural proteinaceous silk fibers called fibroin. This protein is derived from the domesticated silkworm species Bombyx mori of the family bombycidae. The silk fibers are treated to remove the naturally-occurring sericin gum, bleached and braided to produce SOFSILK™ surgical silk sutures. The braided sutures are available coated uniformly with silicone or wax to reduce capillarity and to increase surface lubricity to enhance handling characteristics, ease of passage through tissue and knot run-down properties. The manufacturing process, from braiding to coating, gives the suture superior softness and compliance for maximum surgical hand. The proprietary coating process provides smooth flow through tissue while maintaining optimal knot security. SOFSILK™ sutures are indicated for use in general soft tissue approximation and/or ligation, including use in cardiovascular, ophthalmic and neurological surgery.

Unlike other skin barriers that can break down around liquid output, Durahesive® skin barriers swell up to protect the stoma. This special effect, called turtlenecking, helps create a more secure seal without harming the skin. Durahesive® skin barriers are also easy to fit, apply, and remove.

Utilizes a high-pressure jet of sterile saline that travels parallel to the wound surface. This high-speed jet creates a Venturi effect that enables the surgeon to simultaneously hold, cut and remove tissue, while irrigating and aspirating the wound, with a single instrument. This new technology allows the surgeon to differentiate between tissue types through technique as well as by varying power settings, therefore, sparing viable tissue while precisely targeting and removing debris and damaged tissue. Rapid and effective hydrosurgical debridement using the system can help to reduce procedure times as well as potentially reducing the number of debridements each wound requires compared to traditional modalities e.g. the use of scalpel and pulsed lavage. This modality is suitable for surgical debridement of chronic and acute wounds in the operating room with the patient undergoing general anesthesia.	66800042	Hydrosurgery Handpiece, Exact, 8mm, 45°, 5/cs (US Only)			SMI 66800042	cs	3654.8200	1		Stock Item	21	Surgery/Minor Procedure	183	Miscellaneous	896	Miscellaneous Products	N	N
